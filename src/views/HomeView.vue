    <h1>Overl.ae &ndash; Quick and Easy Overlays</h1>

    <p>Ever host an online tournament but your audience can't tell who's playing?</p>

    <p>Ever running an event on your stream but the timer software just doesn't work like you want it to?</p>

    <p>
      Well, you certainly came to the right place! What I've done here is set up a few simple URLs that you can use
      on your streams (completely free btw) to show off your name and pronouns, or set up a timer or countdown for
      an important event.
    </p>

    <h3>How does it work?</h3>

    <p>
      You can use any of the overlays by simply adding a new browser source to the scene you want in your 
      streaming software, e.g. OBS Studio. Then generate a URL for the overlay you need and paste it into
      the browser source's URL, and you're good to go!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Please note: you will get the best result by setting the browser source full-screen and making it's dimensions
      the same size that you're streaming in, usually something like 1920 x 1080 for HD streams. Check the resolution
      of your stream in the settings of your streaming software!
    </p>
